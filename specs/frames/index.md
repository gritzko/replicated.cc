# Frames

A frame is a collection of ops (operations) applied/executed atomically: either all or nothing.
A frame may contain a multitude of [chunks](/specs/glossary#chunk) - object states, separate ops, patches, queries and so on. 

Frames canâ€™t be split (but they can be joined together).

In the textual RON, frames end with a `.` dot.
Chunks within a frame end with a semicolon `;` (events) an exclamation mark `!` (assertions/new writes) or question mark `?` (queries).


## Event chunks

As RON is an [event-sourced](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) format, any relay of data is made by sending some collection of immutable ops.
These ops express certain events that already happened.
The final state of a system is a [reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_\(higher-order_function\)) of those ops.

Those event ops may come in different groupings.
Before any reduction, these are separate raw ops, or spans and chains of raw ops.
After a reduction, ops form either an object state or a patch or some combination of these.

A minimal object state  would consist of just a header (the object creation op):
<pre><span class="line">  1 </span><span class="id">@1D4ICCA+XU5eRJ</span> <span class="span">:lww</span><span class="term">;</span> <span class="full_stop">.</span>
</pre>

Here is an example of a frame containing one chunk, a state of a Last-Write-Wins object:

<pre><span class="line">  1 </span><span class="id">@1D4ICCA+XU5eRJ</span> <span class="span">:lww</span><span class="term">,</span>
<span class="line">  2 </span>     <span class="str_span">&apos;x&apos;</span> <span class="int">356</span><span class="term">,</span>
<span class="line">  3 </span>     <span class="str_span">&apos;y&apos;</span> <span class="int">83</span><span class="term">;</span>
<span class="line">  4 </span><span class="full_stop">.</span>
</pre>


## Assertions

Assertions are events as they happen, before they get serialized as immutable ops.
Asserions are only used between a RON replica and some external entity.
Effectively, that is a part of the external API of a RON system.
While being serialized as ops, assertions don't have event UUIDs, they are not immutable, they are not relay-able.

Suppose, we'd like to correct a text "Helo world." into "Hello world!".
Internally, that text is kept as a RON RGA object.
We don't like to fiddle with RGA, so we make a write through a `txt` mapper by issuing an assertion:
<pre><span class="line">  1 </span><span class="derived_id">@1l54hK-test</span> <span class="span">:txt</span> <span class="str_span">patch</span><span class="term">,</span> <span class="int">3</span> <span class="str_span">&apos;l&apos;</span> <span class="int">10</span> <span class="int">-1</span> <span class="int">10</span> <span class="str_span">&apos;!&apos;</span> <span class="term">!</span>
</pre>

## Queries

Suppose, we'd like to read the hello-world text mentioned above.
The,we should issue a query to a RON system:

<pre><span class="line">  1 </span><span class="derived_id">@1l54hK-test</span> <span class="span">:txt</span> <span class="term">?</span>
</pre>

A query should be evaluated in the context of its frame, including all the effect of all the preceding ops.

## Compression

Within a frame, ops might be compressed.
Various RON serializations may employ various compression tricks.
The textual RON employs chain compression:

1. the reference UUID is skipped if it matches the id of the previous op,
2. the id of the op is skipped if it is an increment of the the previous op id.

This way, op spans only mention UUIDs in the first op, others are skipped. 

In this example, a frame contains a single chunk which is an object state consisting of a single three-op span:

<pre><span class="line">  1 </span><span class="id">@1D4ICCA+XU5eRJ</span> <span class="span">:lww</span><span class="term">,</span>
<span class="line">  2 </span>     <span class="str_span">&apos;x&apos;</span> <span class="int">356</span><span class="term">,</span>
<span class="line">  3 </span>     <span class="str_span">&apos;y&apos;</span> <span class="int">83</span><span class="term">;</span>
<span class="line">  4 </span><span class="full_stop">.</span>
</pre>
