# Ops

Op term fields may have cited length of 0000 or be skipped if they match the previous op's term. Still, sometimes we want to introduce redundancy, CRC/checksumming, hashing, etc. Exactly for this purpose we may use non-empty terms. The checksumming method is specified by the field length (TODO).
