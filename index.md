# Replicated Object Notation

Replicated Object Notation (RON) is a format for *distributed live data*. 
RON's primary mission is continuous data synchronization.

[JSON](htp://json.org), [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/),
and many others, all imply serialization of state snapshots.
RON handles state and updates all the same: _state is change and change is state_.

RON has versioning and addressing, all built in.
Every RON object may naturally have any number of replicas,
which may synchronize in real-time or live offline. 
Every object, every change, every version has a globally unique UUID.
Thanks to CRDTs and UUIDs, all changes merge and converge consistently.

Here is a simple object serialized in RON:

Key RON principles are:

- **Immutability** - RON sees data as a collection of immutable timestamped ops. 
        In the example above, we have an object state consisting of ten ops 
        (object creation op at line #1, the initial changeset #2 to #8,
        another changeset of two ops #9+10 and #11).
        An op may be referenced, transmitted, stored, applied or rolled back,
        garbage collected, etc.
        Virtually every RON data structure is a collection of immutable ops
        (patch, state, chain, chunk, frame, object graph, log, yarn, etc).
- **Integrity**, as ops form a Merkle tree.
        The data is integrity-checked to the last bit, if necessary, like
        in git, BitTorrent, BitCoin and other such systems.
        Above, ten ops form a Merkle chain, so the hash of the last op
        (line #12) covers them all.
- **Addressability** of everything. Changes, versions, objects and every
        piece of data is uniquely identified and globally referenceable.
        Above, the first op has an id `1fLDV+biQFvtGV`, the second one is
        `1fLDV00001+biQFvtGV`, the third is `1fLDV00002+biQFvtGV`
        and so on (incremental ids are skipped).
        The last two ops (#9-10 and #11) belong to a later changeset, so their
        ids are `1fLDk4+biQFvtGV`, `1fLDk40001+biQFvtGV`.
- **Causality**. Each RON operation explicitly *references* what other op
        it is based on.
        No matter how and when you get your data, you can always reconstruct
        the correct order and location of data pieces.
        Above, ops form an orderly chain, so references are skipped, except
        for the object creation op at line #1 which references its data type `lww`.
- **Efficiency**. RON data is optimized to make metadata overhead bearable.
        An op is a very fine-grained unit of change.
        Thus, RON has to optimize per-op metadata overhead in numerous ways.
        Above, both op ids and references are skipped if they go incrementally.
        For example, the op at line #2 mentions neither its own id
        (the first plus 1) nor its reference (the first op).
        The binary variant of RON employs more sophisticated metadata
        compression techniques. 

RON is an answer to the new reality: swarms of mobile devices communicating over unreliable wireless networks in an untrusted environment.
