# Replicated Object Notation

Replicated Object Notation (RON) is a format for *distributed live data*. 
RON's primary mission is continuous data synchronization.
A RON object may naturally have any number of replicas, which may synchronize in real-time or intermittently. 

[JSON](htp://json.org), [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/),
and many other formats *implicitly assume* serialization of separate state snapshots.
RON handles state and updates all the same: _state is change and change is state_.
RON has metadata, versioning and addressing, all built in.
Every object, every change, every version has a globally unique UUID.
Pieces of data reference each other by UUIDs.
Every RON data type is a CRDT.
With RON metadata, state and updates could always be pieced together.
It always merges, it always converges.

Yet another way to look at it: RON is like a metric system for data.
The [imperial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units)
employed various usage-based units: foots, lines, furlongs, links, cables, etc.
The [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system)
defines one unit (a meter), then derives other units from that.
Similarly, data might be packed into usage-based units: snapshots,
logs, chunks, batches, patches.
RON defines an immutable *op*, then derives other units from that,
be that data structures (arrays, maps, sets, etc) or storage/transmission units
(snapshots, batches/patches, logs, [etc](/specs/glossary)).

Here is a simple object serialized in RON:

Key RON principles are:

- **Immutability** - RON sees data as a collection of immutable timestamped ops. 
        In the example above, we have an object state consisting of ten ops 
        (object creation op at line #1, the initial changeset #2 to #8,
        another changeset of two ops #9/10 and #11).
        An op may be referenced, transmitted, stored, applied or rolled back,
        garbage collected, etc.
        Every RON data structure (array, object, map, set, etc)
        is a collection of immutable ops.
        Similarly, every data storage or transmission unit is made of ops
        (patch, state, chain, chunk, frame, object graph, log, yarn, 
        [etc](/specs/glossary/)).
- **Addressability** of everything. Changes, versions, objects and every
        piece of data is uniquely identified and globally referenceable.
        Above, the first op has an id `1fLDV+biQFvtGV`, the second one is
        `1fLDV00001+biQFvtGV`, the third is `1fLDV00002+biQFvtGV`
        and so on (the notation skips incremental ids).
        The last two ops (#9-10 and #11) belong to a later changeset, so their
        ids are `1fLDk4+biQFvtGV`, `1fLDk40001+biQFvtGV`.
- **Causality**. Each RON operation explicitly *references* what other op
        it is based on.
        No matter how and when you get your data, you can always reconstruct
        the correct order and location of data pieces.
        Above, ops form an orderly chain, so references are skipped, except
        for the object creation op at line #1 which references its data type `lww`.
        With no abbreviations, the object would look like a tabular log of ops, two
        metadata UUIDs per op:
<pre style="font-size: 80%;">
<span class="line">  1 </span><span class="id">@1fLDV00000+biQFvtGV</span> <span class="ref">:lww</span> <span class="term">!</span>
<span class="line">  2 </span><span class="id">@1fLDV00001+biQFvtGV</span>  <span class="ref">:1fLDV00000+biQFvtGV</span> <span class="string">&apos;id&apos;</span>        <span class="string">&apos;20MF000CUS&apos;</span><span class="term">,</span>
<span class="line">  3 </span><span class="id">@1fLDV00002+biQFvtGV</span>  <span class="ref">:1fLDV00001+biQFvtGV</span> <span class="string">&apos;type&apos;</span>      <span class="string">&apos;laptop&apos;</span><span class="term">,</span>
<span class="line">    ...</span>
</pre>
- **Efficiency**. RON data is optimized to make metadata overhead bearable.
        An op is a very fine-grained unit of change.
        Thus, RON has to optimize per-op metadata overhead in numerous ways.
        Above, op ids are skipped if they go incrementally.
        References are skipped if they point to the previous op
        (an op chain is a convenient default).
        For example, the op at line #2 mentions neither its own id
        (the first plus 1) nor its reference (the first op).
        The binary variant of RON employs more sophisticated metadata
        compression techniques. 
- **Integrity**, as ops form a [Merkle structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree).
        If necessary, the data is integrity-checked to the last bit, like
        in git, BitTorrent, BitCoin and other such systems.
        In the example above, ten ops form a Merkle chain, so the hash of the last op
        (line #12) covers them all.

RON's vision is swarms of mobile devices communicating over unreliable wireless networks in an untrusted environment.
